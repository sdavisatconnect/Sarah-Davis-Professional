                <p><strong>Curriculum Associates<br>
                Hiring Manager<br>
                Re: Director, Product, AI Lab Position</strong></p>

                <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

                <p>I am excited to apply for the Director, Product, AI Lab position at Curriculum Associates. Your mission to unlock the potential of every child through innovative educational technology aligns perfectly with my 20+ years developing EdTech solutions that measurably improve student outcomes. My unique combination of hands-on AI curriculum development, cross-functional product leadership, and deep K-12 domain expertise positions me to drive the strategic direction of your AI Labs portfolio.</p>

                <p><strong>AI Innovation & Product Development Experience</strong></p>
                <p>I am currently pioneering AI-enhanced curriculum development as a consultant for MIND Education, where I developed innovative processes using Claude AI to generate high-quality teacher guides for their K-6 mathematics curriculum. This work required creating sophisticated data collection protocols, engineering effective prompts, and learning AI system behaviors to minimize poor quality output. My AI-generated teacher guides supported InsightMath curriculum that achieved unanimous California state adoption approval with zero revision requests—demonstrating my ability to leverage AI capabilities to enhance educational product development.</p>

                <p>Beyond current implementation, I've developed strategic vision for AI's transformative potential in education, including innovative assessment methodologies that could disrupt traditional educational measurement and harness classroom-generated data for real-time instructional insights. This forward-thinking approach to AI integration positions me to identify and capitalize on emerging opportunities in your AI Labs portfolio.</p>

                <p>My product development foundation comes from Texas Instruments, where I served as one of three project managers coordinating the simultaneous launch of five major products, including TI-Navigator, the industry's first real-time networked learning system. This role required managing cross-functional teams spanning product definition, software development, hardware development, and marketing—exactly the type of coordination needed for your AI Labs portfolio spanning multiple product categories. My approach emphasized iterative development based on continuous user feedback, rapid response to changing requirements, and stakeholder-centered design—core principles of effective Agile methodology.</p>

                <p><strong>Cross-Functional Leadership & Team Management</strong></p>
                <p>At Portland Public Schools, I built and managed a department of 40+ staff through 5 direct reports, with direct budget authority for $4M+ annual spending. This experience scaling teams while maintaining strategic focus directly translates to the leadership requirements for growing your AI Labs product management organization. I've consistently demonstrated the ability to mentor and develop high-performing teams while fostering cultures of collaboration and innovation.</p>

                <p>My approach to cross-functional collaboration centers on translating between technical capabilities and user needs. At Texas Instruments, I served as the primary liaison between our 60-teacher pilot community across 30 schools and engineering teams, iteratively refining product features based on real classroom usage. This user-centric approach ensured our products solved genuine educational challenges rather than just showcasing technical capabilities.</p>

                <p><strong>EdTech Market Intelligence & Strategic Vision</strong></p>
                <p>My 20+ years in K-12 education provide the deep market understanding essential for defining successful AI Labs strategies. I understand not just what educators say they want, but what actually drives adoption and measurable learning outcomes. My implementation of district-wide assessment systems and curriculum redesigns that achieved 154% increases in advanced course enrollment demonstrate my ability to translate product innovations into concrete educational impact.</p>

                <p>Through my participation in the SIIA AI Committee, I stay current with emerging trends and competitive landscape developments, bringing market intelligence that informs strategic product decisions. My international experience developing educational solutions across eight countries provides perspective on scaling products across diverse educational contexts.</p>

                <p><strong>Performance-Driven Approach & Compliance Expertise</strong></p>
                <p>I excel at defining success metrics and iterating based on data. My work managing over $10M in federal grants required rigorous performance tracking, compliance with educational standards (including FERPA), and stakeholder reporting—experience that directly applies to the compliance and performance measurement requirements you've outlined. My published research on educational technology effectiveness demonstrates my commitment to evidence-based product development.</p>

                <p><strong>Strategic Alignment with Curriculum Associates' Mission</strong></p>
                <p>Your focus on serving educators and supporting accessible learning experiences resonates deeply with my career trajectory. At MIND Education, I've seen firsthand how thoughtfully designed AI can enhance rather than replace human expertise, making quality educational content more accessible while maintaining pedagogical rigor. My experience implementing technology solutions across diverse student populations, including historically underserved communities, aligns with your commitment to equity and inclusion.</p>

                <p>I am particularly excited about the opportunity to shape AI Labs initiatives that span hardware, software, and curriculum offerings. My background coordinating complex product ecosystems, combined with current AI development work and deep educational domain expertise, positions me to help Curriculum Associates maintain its leadership in transforming education through technology innovation.</p>

                <p>I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my unique combination of AI innovation experience, product leadership capabilities, and educational market expertise can contribute to your AI Labs team's continued success. Thank you for considering my application.</p>

                <p>Sincerely,<br>
                <strong>Sarah M. Davis, Ph.D.</strong></p>
